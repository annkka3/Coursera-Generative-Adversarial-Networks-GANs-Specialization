Please note that this is an optional notebook, meant to introduce more advanced concepts if you're up for a challenge, so don't worry if you don't completely follow!

In this notebook, you will learn about and implement MUNIT, a method for unsupervised image-to-image translation, as proposed in Multimodal Unsupervised Image-to-Image Translation (Huang et al. 2018).
