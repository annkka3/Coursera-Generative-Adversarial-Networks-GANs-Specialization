# Connect with your mentors and fellow learners on Slack!

Hi! If you have not already, we've created a Slack workspace that we'd like you to join!

In Slack,

+ You can ask questions and interact with mentors and other learners. Mentors will primarily be answering questions in Slack!

+ Attend live, virtual events where you can hear from practitioners in the field.

+ Find out about opportunities to work more directly with deeplearning.ai as mentors.

## Please join the Slack workspace by going to the following link DeepLearningAI-GANs.slack.com

This link to join slack was last updated on October 27, 08:00AM PST. If the link has expired, please reply to this discussion forum post and we will update the invitation link.

**Note that the mentors will be answering questions in the Slack workspace and not necessarily the discussion forums on Coursera (so that all questions and answers are in the same place), so you are encouraged to ask questions within Slack.**

This Slack workspace includes all courses of this specialization.

## The mentors for this specialization are:

Paul Mielke

Mo Rebaie

Mahmoud Jameel Soliman

Jonas Klesen

Guillaume Sanchez

Sven Chilton
