# Syllabus

Welcome to Course 3 of Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs): Apply Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs)! We hope you are excited to keep learning.

To make sure you are best equipped to learn, here is (again) the note on the prerequisites for this specialization:

This specialization is designed for someone without familiarity with GANs to come in, learn the basics in Course 1, and still succeed with learning the advanced topics presented in Course 2 and 3. If you are familiar with GANs or consider yourself an advanced learner, you may find it most enriching to view the videos that youâ€™re unfamiliar with and supplement your learning with the optional notebooks. For anyone curious about a concept covered, you can also take a look at the optional readings for that week!

Here's a peek into Course 3: you will start Week 1 by learning different applications of GANs and specifically the pros/cons of using GANs for data augmentation. The following week, Week 2, you will understand what image-to-image translation is and implement Pix2Pix, a paired image-to-image translation GAN. In the final Week 3, you will learn how unpaired image-to-image translation differs from paired translation and implement CycleGAN which uses two GANs to transform between horses and zebras.

+ Week 1: GANs for Data Augmentation and Privacy

+ Week 2: Image-to-Image Translation with Pix2Pix

+ Week 3: Unpaired Translation with CycleGAN

Let's continue learning!
