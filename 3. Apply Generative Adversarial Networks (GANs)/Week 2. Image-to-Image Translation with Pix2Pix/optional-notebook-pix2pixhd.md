# (Optional Notebook) Pix2PixHD

Please note that this is an optional notebook, meant to introduce more advanced concepts if you're up for a challenge, so don't worry if you don't completely follow!

In this notebook, you will learn about Pix2PixHD, which synthesizes high-resolution images from semantic label maps. Proposed in High-Resolution Image Synthesis and Semantic Manipulation with Conditional GANs (Wang et al. 2018), Pix2PixHD improves upon Pix2Pix via multiscale architecture, improved adversarial loss, and instance maps.
