# (Optional Notebook) GauGAN

https://colab.research.google.com/github/https-deeplearning-ai/GANs-Public/blob/master/C3W2_GauGAN_(Optional).ipynb

Please note that this is an optional notebook meant to introduce more advanced concepts. If you’re up for a challenge, take a look and don’t worry if you can’t follow everything. There is no code to implement—only some cool code for you to learn and run!

In this notebook, you will learn about GauGAN, which synthesizes high-resolution images from semantic label maps, which you implement and train. GauGAN is based around a special denormalization technique proposed in Semantic Image Synthesis with Spatially-Adaptive Normalization (Park et al. 2019)
