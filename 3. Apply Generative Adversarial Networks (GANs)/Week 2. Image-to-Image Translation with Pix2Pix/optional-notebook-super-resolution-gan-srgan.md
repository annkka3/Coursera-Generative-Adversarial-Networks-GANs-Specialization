# (Optional Notebook) Super-resolution GAN (SRGAN)

https://colab.research.google.com/github/https-deeplearning-ai/GANs-Public/blob/master/C3W2_SRGAN_(Optional).ipynb

Please note that this is an optional notebook meant to introduce more advanced concepts. If you’re up for a challenge, take a look and don’t worry if you can’t follow everything. There is no code to implement—only some cool code for you to learn and run!

In this notebook, you will learn about Super-Resolution GAN (SRGAN), a GAN that enhances the resolution of images by 4x, proposed in Photo-Realistic Single Image Super-Resolution Using a Generative Adversarial Network (Ledig et al. 2017). You will also implement the architecture and training in full and be able to train it on the CIFAR dataset.
